I decided to go fumble about in other repositories and see if there were any really easy bugs that needed fixing. I managed to get two bugs fixed on government.github.io and my pull request passed the checks. The only thing that hasn't gone through is the pull itself, the repo owners are likely still looking it over. Overall, today was a success.
