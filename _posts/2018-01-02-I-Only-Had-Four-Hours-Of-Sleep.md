AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I'm more tired than I was when I went to sleep. How the fuck does that happen?

I'll see what I can do about CSS shit today. However, since I'm still legally a gremlin, I'm going to have to put a lot of work to rest to get schoolwork done since classes resume tommorow.

*it's drainin' i tells ya*

Edit: Jesus fucking christ trying to get a gemmed theme working on here is frustrating.
