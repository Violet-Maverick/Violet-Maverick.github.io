AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I'm more tired than I was when I went to sleep. How the fuck does that happen?

I'll see what I can do about CSS shit today. However, since I'm still legally a gremlin, I'm going to have to put a lot of work to rest to get schoolwork done since classes resume tommorow.

*it's drainin' i tells ya*

Edit: Jesus fucking christ trying to get a gemmed theme working on here is frustrating.

More fucking edits: Alright, so get this. I'm probably going to have to recreate the website from fucking scratch in order to get what I want for CSS. Yes, from scratch. If you don't see this blog post later, you know why.
